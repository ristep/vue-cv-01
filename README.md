# vue-cv

CV &amp; Resume created with Vue and JSON

Vue is best javascript framework Iâ€™ve ever been learned.

For that reason, I decided to make my CV framed in Vue.

An online live demo is here.

### Installation

```sh
$ mkdir vue-cv
$ cd vue-cv
```
Clone this [git](https://github.com/ristep/vue-cv.git) or extract [.zip](https://github.com/ristep/vue-cv/archive/master.zip) in created `vue-cv`, then:

```sh
$ yarn
$ yarn serve
```
If don't have yarn install it with this:
```sh
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install yarn
```
For other than Ubuntu/Debian see [this article](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

For production environments...
```sh
$ yarn run buld
```
### Server side

Put [this](https://github.com/ristep/vue-cv/tree/master/src/server-side) files on some web server with .php
and change `baseURL: "http://capi.rp/",` as needet, in [ajax-axios.js](https://github.com/ristep/vue-cv/blob/master/src/ajax-axios.js).
